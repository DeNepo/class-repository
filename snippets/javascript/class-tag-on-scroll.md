# change class tag on scroll

## description

> this snippet will change a preassigned tag to a class on scroll by adding an
> 'event listener' property

## application

> this snippet is useful when we want to activate an animation or reveal
> elements on scroll

### code

```javascript
'use strict';

window.addEventListener('scroll', show);

/* ^ AddEventListener is the name of the function. it contains two - parameters -
an - event - which we named scroll and a -function - a thing that will happen 
when the event is triggered the  - show - class name */

function show() {
  let show = document.querySelectorAll('.hide');

  /* ^ hide is a class name that will be added to the classes in html 
  after the class itself. example - class="container hide"
  the class name can be used to get to the element itself */

  for (let i = 0; i < hide.length; i++) {
    // ^ here we assign a variable - i - and set a condition for its value
    // it will loop until the condition becomes true

    let windowheight = window.innerHeight;

    /* ^ declare a variable and assign it a value equal to
  the scroll window's inner height */

    let showtop = hide[i].getBoundingClientRect().top;

    /* ^ declare another variable and assign it to the - hide - tag for
the variable - i - and add get bounding rect property this will return
the element's size and position on screen */

    let showpoint = 200;

    /* ^ one last variable... assigned the number of pixels from
  the bottom of the screen we must scroll before the tag changes */

    if (showtop < windowheight - showpoint) {
      hide[i].classList.add('show');

      /* ok, this is the cool part. here we set a condition, it says
      if the position/scale of the
      element(which we assigned the - hide - tag to) passes a point in
      the window height that is equal to the amount of pixels from the
      bottom we specified subtracted from the overall window height,
      then something will happen, that thing being the class name 
      - show - will be added to the classes with the - hide - class name
      now we can assign new properties for the - show - tag in css */
    } else {
      hide[i].classList.remove('show');
      /* ^ this last little bit completes the condition, stating that
      if the position of the element does not pass the pixel amount we
      specified the tag will revert to - hide - and with it the css
      properties we created for the - hide - tag */
    }
  }
}
```
